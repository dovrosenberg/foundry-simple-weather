## v1.15.2 - Bug fix for Simple Calendar compact mode
#### Support for Simple Calendar v2.4.18
![](https://img.shields.io/badge/release%20date-September%209%2C%202024-blue)
![GitHub release](https://img.shields.io/github/downloads-pre/dovrosenberg/foundry-simple-weather/v1.15.2/module.zip)

Fixed bug where you couldn't set weather manually when attached to a compact Simple Calendar window.

## v1.15.1 - Re-enable ability to set weather via scene settings
#### Support for Simple Calendar v2.4.18
![](https://img.shields.io/badge/release%20date-September%201%2C%202024-blue)
![GitHub release](https://img.shields.io/github/downloads-pre/dovrosenberg/foundry-simple-weather/v1.15.1/module.zip)

Fix to let you use the Ambiance tabe in scene settings to set weather.  Note that this will (obviously) get the weather out of sync with Simple Weather, which will confuse it.  Generally, hitting the "Toggle FX" button (that looks like the raining cloud) twice (i.e. on/off or off/on, depending on its current state) should let Simple Weather take back over.

## v1.15.0 - Workaround for FXMaster issue causing long delays in updating visual effects
#### Support for Simple Calendar v2.4.18
![](https://img.shields.io/badge/release%20date-August%2029%2C%202024-blue)
![GitHub release](https://img.shields.io/github/downloads-pre/dovrosenberg/foundry-simple-weather/v1.15.0/module.zip)

Workaround to FXMaster issue (https://github.com/ghost-fvtt/fxmaster/issues/761) that was causing long delays in effects 
being turned on/off.  They should now update immediately when changing scenes, applying new weather, or toggling FX on/off.  
Thanks for your patience - I know this issue has been painful to deal with.

#### Support for Simple Calendar v2.4.13
![](https://img.shields.io/badge/release%20date-May%2018%2C%202024-blue)
![GitHub release](https://img.shields.io/github/downloads-pre/dovrosenberg/foundry-simple-weather/v1.12.1/module.zip)

Fixed an issue where weather FX weren't always turning off when switching to a condition without them (ex. switching from rain to clear sky).

## v1.12.0 - Custom chat text
#### Support for Simple Calendar v2.4.13
![](https://img.shields.io/badge/release%20date-May%2018%2C%202024-blue)
![GitHub release](https://img.shields.io/github/downloads-pre/dovrosenberg/foundry-simple-weather/v1.12.0/module.zip)

There is now the ability to manually add any additional text you want to be displayed to chat for each weather condition (ex. system-specific penalties for movement during a blizzard).

This is the first pass at this functionality.  For now, these custom messages are unreliable when manually specifying weather.  I also plan to expand it to enable you to save/load values using external files, in order to create different sets for differen systems that can easily be swapped in and out.

The initial public release.

- Intuitive UI to generate weather and see current time from Simple Calendar 
- Print the weather to chat, with the option of showing to players or not
- Choose whether players can see the dialog
- Generate weather for every new day automatically
- Randomized weather for every season across 3 climates (hot, temperate, cold) and 3 humidities (barren, modest, verdant)
- Weather progresses naturally from day to day
- Supports Farenheit and Celsius temperatures

As the GM you will also be able to change the current day in your game and add notes to days. Notes can be events or reminders and can be visible to players or just the GM.

The players are presented with a familiar calendar interface for switching between months and selecting days to see any notes on those days.
