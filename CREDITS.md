## Used modules

### Simple Calendar

Simple Weather heavily relies on [Simple Calendar](https://github.com/vigoren/foundryvtt-simple-calendar) by [Vigoren](https://github.com/vigoren). 

## Weather algorithm
The weather algorithm was inspired by:
- [Dave's All-Purpose Weather Table](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1j0d1MtsWtJT-Q-Ncbl8DsBlf6cK51j5T13JTll5bSTE/edit#gid=0) from reddit user u/AlliedSalad2 
- [This weather system](https://github.com/dovrosenberg/foundry-simple-weather/blob/master/docs/weather.png) from reddit user u/iceandstorm as described in the comments to [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/rpg/comments/p0wq9n/weather_hex_flower_random_weather_generation/)

## Other thanks

### Simple Calendar
Thank you to [Vigoren](https://github.com/vigoren) for the simple API.

### Original Author

You can't easily tell, because this is a rebuild, rather than a fork, but this module began on top of the work on [Weather Control](https://gitlab.com/jstebenne/foundryvtt-weather-control) by Julien Stébenne.  As I learned how to develop a module for Foundry VTT, having this as a solid starting point was invaluable.
